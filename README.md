# Plans and ideas:
* Add player object
* lasers are stored in a ship, but I would rather the Game obj to store it so lasers don't disappear when ship is killed
* change game structure - add some packaging logic
* Add a state queue mechanic
* use some graphic for entities
* Add shooting enemies
* Add game menu
* Add player upgrades which enemies can drop
* Brainstorm scripted level design
